# bedeepon

bedeepon is a tool based on deep learning for predicting editing efficiency and editing outcomes. Although previously there are some relative works on predicting editing outcomes, the flaw and inaccracy of these models can not be ignored. Consequently, a brand new model which improves the shortcomings and provides insights into the mechanisms of editing efficiency via data integration and benchmarking is proposed in this work.
